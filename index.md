## Introduction

*february, 25th, 2022*

 The objective was definded as a comparisson a of Domain Adaptation (DA) representatives of the state of the art for the application of deforestation detection from Sentinel-2 images.


 ## Pre-flight Plan

*february, 25th, 2022*

 ### Source and Target Dataset definition:
 
 Regions around the Amazon -> Cerrado biomes;
 
 ### DA methods scope definition: 

 - ADDA
 - DANN
 - CycleGAN
 - Dennis method;
 - CyCADA
 - TBD

 ### Tunning

 It is scheduled trials for tunning some methods in the scope.

 ## Dataset Regions
